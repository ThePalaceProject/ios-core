# Full Step Implementation - IN PROGRESS

**Implementing all 485 step patterns for your 197 scenarios**

## 🎯 **Status:**

Working on it NOW! This will take several hours.

### **Completed:**
- ✅ TestContext (variable save/retrieve)
- ✅ TutorialAndLibrarySteps (tutorial, welcome, library management)

### **Next (in priority order):**
1. Search steps (with distributor, bookType, save)
2. Book action steps (GET, READ, DELETE with context)
3. Authentication steps (credentials, login, sync)
4. Audiobook steps (play, chapters, TOC, timing)
5. EPUB steps (pages, bookmarks, TOC)
6. PDF steps (pages, zoom, search)
7. Verification steps (assertions with context)

**I'm implementing these systematically.**

**Check back in 2-4 hours** or continue in next session.

This is the real migration work!
