# Code Comment Guidelines for Palace iOS

## No Jira Ticket References in Code

**NEVER include Jira ticket numbers (e.g., PP-123, PALACE-456) in code comments.**

### Why

- Ticket numbers become meaningless over time as Jira projects evolve
- Code should be self-documenting without requiring external context
- Comments should explain "why" not reference external tracking systems
- Ticket references clutter the codebase and don't add value to future readers

### Instead

- Write clear, descriptive comments that explain the reasoning
- Reference the behavior or bug being addressed, not the ticket
- Use git commit messages to link tickets (not code comments)

### Bad Examples

```swift
// PP-418: Fix cross-domain redirect issue
// PALACE-123: Handle token refresh
// Fixes ticket #456
```

### Good Examples

```swift
// A 401 from a cross-domain redirect does NOT mean our credentials
// are expired - it's a third-party auth issue
// Token refresh should preserve Adobe DRM activation state
```

### Git Commits

Ticket references ARE appropriate in git commit messages for traceability:

```
Fix false credential expiration on cross-domain redirect 401s

Resolves PP-418
```
